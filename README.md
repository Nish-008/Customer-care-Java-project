The project is on ‘Online Customer Care and Service Center’. 
After running the code, the first window shows a ‘Login’
window where the user can select whether they are a customer 
or an employee. If the user selects ‘customer’ from the options 
drop down menu, they will be redirected to a ‘Customer Help 
Line’ window after clicking Login. There some preset problems 
and their solutions are given which can be accessed after 
selecting a problem and clicking the ‘Find Solution’ button. If 
the customer does not find their desired solution they can 
select the ‘Cannot find my problem here’ option to be 
redirected to another window. This is the ‘Service Request
Form’. Customers can provide the required data here to 
request service from the employees. Each window has a option 
to be redirected to the ‘Login’ window. Again, from the ‘Login’
window, if the user selects the ‘Employee’ option, they are 
required to enter the correct password. After logging in 
successfully, employees can see a ‘Requested Service List’
which shows the list and information of all the customers who 
require service. By selecting a row and clicking ‘Show’ the 
employee can see the form of that particular customer. If the 
problem of that customer is solved, that particular row can be 
cleared by clicking the ‘Clear’ button.
